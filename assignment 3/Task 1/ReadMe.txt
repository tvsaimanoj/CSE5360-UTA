	To run the code, execute maxconnect4.py with standard python compilation commands (works on omega)

	For interactive mode, pass the following arguments:
		python maxconnect4.py interactive [input_file] [computer-next/human-next] [depth]

	For one-move mode, pass the following arguments:
		python maxconnect4.py one-move [input_file] [output_file] [depth]
